# Development Journal

## Project Status Overview
**Last Updated:** [7/15/2025]  
**Version:** Pre-Production (95% Complete)  
**Priority:** Styling optimization & final polish

### Core Architecture ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] TypeScript + Next.js foundation
- [x] Tailwind with geometric theme system (3 design variants)
- [x] Component-level styling management (no shared style stores)
- [x] Dark/light theme via browser settings
- [x] Multilanguage context system
- [x] Production-ready fetching & search
- [x] Custom markdown processing with blockquotes & image carousels
- [x] Navigation system

### Current Sprint: Styling & Polish
- [ ] **Article cards design restore** - Restore theme-sensitive design of all types of article cards
- [ ] **Color scheme selectiion** - Create 3 mode-sensitive color schemes
- [ ] **Prop drilling reduction** - Identify critical paths
- [ ] **Markdown Tailwind styling optimization** - Performance review needed
- [ ] **Heading styling completion** - Cross-theme consistency
- [ ] **Mobile menu styling** - Responsive breakpoints & animations

### Planned Sprints
- [ ] **Prop drilling reduction** - Identify critical paths
- [ ] **Sceleton creation** - App-wide implementation
- [ ] **Authentication** - Create an authentication wrap (protected scope)
- [ ] **Personal user page creation** - Should manage content in protected scope

## Technical Decisions Log

### Architecture Principles
**Styling Philosophy:** Component-level management only
- ‚úÖ Each component owns its styling
- ‚úÖ Wrapper components manage group styling  
- ‚ùå No shared component style storage
- ‚úÖ globals.scss limited to: colors, fonts, geometric constants

**Theme System Impact:**
- Same HTML ‚Üí 3 radically different designs via geometric themes
- Border-radius, font-height calculations centralized in CSS variables
- Theme switching affects entire visual hierarchy

### Key Technical Choices
| Decision                      | Rationale                                 | Status        
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------
| Removed Headless UI           | Conflict with custom theme system         | ‚úÖ Complete   |
| Component-level styling       | Eliminates duplication, clear ownership   | ‚úÖ Active     |
| CSS variables for geometry    | Enable dramatic theme switching           | ‚úÖ Complete   |

## Current Issues & Blockers

### üî• High Priority
1. **Markdown styling performance** - Large articles may have render bottlenecks
2. **Mobile menu UX** - Needs final responsive polish
3. **Heading hierarchy** - Cross-theme typography consistency

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Priority  
1. **Prop drilling hotspots** - Theme context passing could be optimized
2. **Bundle size** - Review if custom markdown processing affects build size

### üìù Low Priority
1. Final documentation review
2. Production deployment checklist

## Testing Notes

### Last Test Session: [Date]
**Multilanguage:** ‚úÖ All app-wide contexts tested  
**Search UX:** ‚úÖ Fully functional, debugged  
**Theme switching:** ‚úÖ All 3 geometric variants working  
**Mobile responsive:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Menu styling pending

### Test Scenarios to Validate
- [ ] Large markdown articles (performance)
- [ ] Theme switching during navigation
- [ ] Language context persistence
- [ ] Mobile menu across all themes
- [ ] Search functionality in all languages

## Performance Monitoring

### Build Metrics
- **Bundle Size:** [Track here]
- **Build Time:** [Track here]  
- **Lighthouse Score:** [Track here]

### Known Performance Considerations
- Custom markdown processing overhead
- Three theme CSS generation
- Image carousel lazy loading

---

## Next Session Planning

### Immediate Tasks (Next 1-2 sessions)
1. **Audit markdown styling** - Identify performance bottlenecks
2. **Complete mobile menu** - Focus on animation consistency across themes  
3. **Heading typography** - Ensure hierarchy works in all 3 geometric themes

### Week Goals
- Complete all styling tasks
- Reduce prop drilling in identified hotspots
- Final cross-browser testing

### Production Readiness Checklist
- [ ] All styling optimization complete
- [ ] Performance benchmarks passed
- [ ] Cross-theme testing complete
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] SEO metadata finalized
- [ ] Production build tested

## Architecture Notes

### Prop Drilling Hotspots
*Document areas where context passing could be optimized*
- Theme context in deeply nested components
- Language context in article components

### Component Hierarchy Critical Paths
*Track components that manage significant styling groups*
- Main layout wrapper ‚Üí theme application
- Article container ‚Üí markdown styling coordination
- Navigation ‚Üí mobile/desktop state management
